# Gas Leak Detection System with ESP32 and Blynk üîç

## Overview

Gas leaks and fires pose significant risks to both safety and lives. 
This project presents an IoT based solution for detecting and alerting users to potential gas leaks and fire hazards. Using gas sensors (*MQ2* and *MQ9*) and an *ESP32 microcontroller*, the system continuously monitors toxic gas levels and triggers visual (using a *LED*) and audio (using a *Buzzer*) alerts when dangerous levels are detected.
In addition to alerting, this system also takes preventive action by controlling windows and ventilation through *bipolar stepper motors* and their *drivers*.
Real-time monitoring and notifications are sent to the user through the *Blynk* mobile application.
The system is also equiped with *LCD screen* to informe the users of its current situation.
